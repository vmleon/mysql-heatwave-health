# MySQL and HeatWave for Health

This workshop is a hands-on experience to test the performance advantages and cost savings you can benefit from by using MySQL HeatWave.

You are going to run queries on a dataset of a fitness tracker. Run them with MySQL Innodb engine and then with HeatWave to speed up your analytical and ML queries.

## HeatWave Introduction

HeatWaveâ€”In-Memory Query Accelerator with Built-in ML.

Increases MySQL performance by orders of magnitude for analytics and mixed workloads. Eliminates the need for a separate analytics database, separate machine learning (ML) tools, and extract, transform, and load (ETL) processes.

## Nice to have

- Performance competition
- Story on the data science (enhance dataset)
- Olympics dataset as alternative?

## Requirements

- Active Oracle Cloud Account (with credits)
- Terraform
- OCI CLI

## Set Up

Clone this repository in OCI Cloud Shell:
```
git clone https://github.com/vmleon/mysql-heatwave-health.git
```

Change directory to the `mysql-heatwave-health`:
```
cd mysql-heatwave-health
```

Export an environment variable with the base directory:
```
export BASE_DIR=$(pwd)
```

## Deployment

Change directory to `deploy/terraform`:
```
cd $BASE_DIR/deploy/terraform
```

Use terraform variables template file to create your own `terraform.tfvars`:
```
cp terraform.tfvars.template terraform.tfvars
```

Edit the variables values with vim or your favorite editor:
```
vim terraform.tfvars
```

Go back to the base directory:
```
cd $BASE_DIR
```

Start the provisioning and deployment:
```
./start.sh
```

## Explore with Mysql Shell

SSH into the compute, change `PUBLIC_IP` for the public IP address:
```
ssh opc@PUBLIC_IP
```

> NOTE: 
> If you are using a non-standard private key path (`~/.ssh/id_rsa`) 
> then add `-i PATH/TO/PRIVATE/KEY`.

```
mysqlsh \
  --mx \
  --user=`USER` \
  --host=`HOST` \
  --password=`PASSWORD` \
  --schema=fitbit
```

> Connection details like `USER`, `HOST` or `PASSWORD` are 
> at the end of the output on the execution of `start.sh`.

You can exit at any point from MySQL Shell with:
```
\q
```

## Website

Paste the Public IP address from the end of the script on your browser.

## Clean Up

Run the script:
```
./stop.sh
```

## Notes on HeatWave

The tables you intend to load must be InnoDB tables. You can manually convert tables to InnoDB using the following ALTER TABLE statement:

```
ALTER TABLE tbl_name ENGINE=InnoDB;
```

The tables you intend to load must be defined with a primary key. You can add a primary key using the following syntax:

```
ALTER TABLE tbl_name ADD PRIMARY KEY (column);
```

Load time is affected if the primary key contains more than one column, or if the primary key column is not an INTEGER column. The impact on MySQL performance during load, change propagation, and query processing depends on factors such as data properties, available resources (compute, memory, and network), and the rate of transaction processing on the MySQL DB System.

To exclude columns from loading into Heatwave:
```
CREATE TABLE orders (id INT, description BLOB NOT SECONDARY);
```

Add `RAPID` as secondary engine for tables:
```
ALTER TABLE orders SECONDARY_ENGINE = RAPID;
CREATE TABLE orders (id INT) SECONDARY_ENGINE = RAPID;
```

Load table to HeatWave:
```
ALTER TABLE orders SECONDARY_LOAD;
```

Alternatively, Auto Parallel Load
```
CALL sys.heatwave_load(JSON_ARRAY("fitbit"),NULL);
```

Monitoring Load Progress:
```
SELECT VARIABLE_VALUE
  FROM performance_schema.global_status
  WHERE VARIABLE_NAME = 'rapid_load_progress';
```

Checking Load Status

```
USE performance_schema;
```

```
SELECT NAME, LOAD_STATUS FROM rpd_tables,rpd_table_id
  WHERE rpd_tables.ID = rpd_table_id.ID;
```

`AVAIL_RPDGSTABSTATE` means the table is loaded.

Data changes on the MySQL DB System node are propagated to HeatWave in batch transactions. Change propagation is initiated as follows:
- Every 200ms.
- When the change propagation buffer reaches its 64MB capacity.
- When data updated by DML operations on the MySQL DB System are read by a subsequent HeatWave query.

Propagation status:
```
SELECT VARIABLE_VALUE FROM performance_schema.global_status WHERE VARIABLE_NAME = 'rapid_change_propagation_status';
```

`autocommit` must be enabled. If `autocommit` is disabled, queries are not offloaded and execution is performed on the MySQL DB System. To check the `autocommit` setting:
```
SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'autocommit';
```

Before running a query, you can use `EXPLAIN` to determine if the query will be offloaded to HeatWave for processing. If so, the Extra column of `EXPLAIN` output shows: `Using secondary engine RAPID`.
```
EXPLAIN SELECT ...
```

To compare HeatWave query execution time with MySQL DB System execution time, disable the use_secondary_engine variable and run the query again to see how long it takes to run on the MySQL DB System.
```
SET SESSION use_secondary_engine=OFF;
```

Unload the table from HeatWave:
```
ALTER TABLE orders SECONDARY_UNLOAD;
```

Some other interesting commands:
```
CALL sys.heatwave_load(JSON_ARRAY('database'), NULL);
```

```
SELECT @@use_secondary_engine;
```

```
USE performance_schema;
SELECT NAME, LOAD_STATUS FROM rpd_tables,rpd_table_id WHERE
rpd_tables.ID = rpd_table_id.ID;
```

```
SET @@use_secondary_engine=OFF;
```
